Hardware map naming:
    all lowercase
    underscores between words
    config name should be the name of the bot, and the year
    all hardware should start with the name of the subsystem, then function. Ex. drive_front_left

    Subsystems for this year:
        drive - front/back first
        lift
        grip
        sensing - camera for cameras, imu for IMU







OpMode naming:
    OpModes should have the bot name first in the class name
    OpModes should have TeleOp or Auto following the bot name
    All opModes are linear
    OpMode title in the driver station should be the same as the class name, with spaces
        instead of caps





General codebase things:
    all program functionality should be in a functions class, or in an opmode.
    all program state should be grouped into Data classes.







Codebase as of now (10.14.22):
    PIDData:
        contains settings for a PID + current data.
        Settings are readonly after construction.

    TelemetryData:
        An easier way of doing telemetry. Current telemetryData is in dynamic, its cleared when sent.
        Use TelemetryFunctions.send() to actually send added data to the drivers hub.
        TelemetryData.addChild() will add a node under the parent, this will be indented when displayed.
        Node children are not accessible after adding.

    NavData:
        Contains Heading, IMU ref, Timer, & DT values.

    DriveData:
        Motor refs, constructed with a flip map.

    ObjectDetectionData:
        TF and Vuforia refs. Initializes on construction.


Functions you need in an opMode (pseudocode):
    Nav.updateHeading, Nav.updateDt
        these update what angle the robot is at, and how long its been since last iteration

    Telemetry.send
        sends all current telemetry to drivers hub
